# Anti-Resume

**What’s stopping your resume from getting selected?
Anti-Resume helps you find out — clearly, fairly, and honestly.**

Anti-Resume is an intelligent resume evaluation and improvement system that analyzes resumes the way **real hiring pipelines do**—through ATS filters, recruiter screening, and engineering review—to identify **exact blockers** preventing shortlisting and guide users in fixing them **without exaggeration or false claims**.

This project focuses on **clarity, alignment, and evidence**, not cosmetic enhancement.

## What Anti-Resume Does

Anti-Resume evaluates resumes in three practical stages, mirroring real-world hiring workflows.

### 1. ATS Readiness Analysis

* Resume parsing confidence and structure validation
* Layout and formatting risk detection
* Keyword coverage against target job roles
* Missing or weakly supported skills identification

**Outcome:** A transparent readiness score with clear improvement areas.

---

### 2. Recruiter Readability Review

* First-scan signal clarity (6–8 second review)
* Bullet structure and consistency
* Generic vs role-specific content detection
* Visibility of outcomes and impact

**Outcome:** Clear guidance on what improves shortlisting chances.

---

### 3. Engineering Depth Assessment

* Skill-to-project evidence mapping
* Detection of shallow or unsupported technical claims
* Evaluation of system-level thinking (auth flows, data handling, error cases)
* Identification of areas needing stronger technical explanation

**Outcome:** Actionable feedback focused on technical credibility.

## Guided Resume Improvement (AI-Assisted)

Anti-Resume includes a **controlled AI correction engine** designed to help users improve their resumes responsibly:

* Modifies only issues **explicitly identified by analysis**
* Makes **minimal, traceable edits**
* Never adds unverified experience, skills, or metrics
* Requires **user approval** for all changes
* Re-evaluates the resume to show measurable improvement

This ensures the resume stays **truthful, aligned, and defensible**.

## Why Anti-Resume Is Different

* Focuses on **selection blockers**, not surface-level polish
* Makes ATS and recruiter decisions **understandable**
* Uses AI with **clear constraints and accountability**
* Treats resumes as **engineering artifacts**, not marketing content

The goal is not to “game the system,” but to **meet it clearly and confidently**.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), TypeScript
* **Backend:** Node.js
* **Resume Parsing:** `pdf-parse`, `mammoth`
* **Database:** MongoDB / PostgreSQL
* **Design:** Modular, rule-driven, production-focused

## Who This Is For

* Candidates who want precise, actionable feedback
* Engineers who value clarity over buzzwords
* Recruiters interested in explainable screening logic
* Anyone curious about how hiring decisions are actually made
